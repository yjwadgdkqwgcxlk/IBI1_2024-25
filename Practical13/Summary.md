Basic information:
Length: 222 amino acids
Subcellular Localisation: mitochondrion matrix

Range of percentage identities: 58.1% to 100%.

Python alignment score and identity:
Human-Mouse：score: 1097, identity: 90.09%
Human-Random：score: -222, identity: 7.21%
Mouse-Random: score: -211, identity: 8.11%

Conclusion (Statement):
Human and mouse SOD2 are obviously the most similar, both in score and identity.
Random sequence shows almost no similarity to either real protein.
