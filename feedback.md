In Week 3, I received feedback saying that some of my commit messages were unclear. I went back and rewrote them so that each commit clearly describes what was changed. For example, I updated the messages for the introductions, thingsIlike, and reflection files to explain exactly what I added or edited.

For Week 4, the main issue was that my variables.py file used Chinese in the output, which shouldn't happen in an English practical. I changed all print statements to English. I also added the missing boolean logic part with variables X, Y, and W, and included a short truth table as a comment to explain it. In the comparison part, I made sure I used c and f, and confirmed that f is greater than c.

In Week 5, the dictionary in the programming language popularity file wasnâ€™t printed, even though it was created. I added a print statement so the dictionary now appears in the output. Everything else in that week was fine.

All changes have been committed with clearer messages, and the updated files reflect the feedback given.
