At first, this practical seemed manageable. I had seen SIR models before, so I thought it would be simple to implement. But once I started coding, I realized that translating the logic into a working simulation—especially a stochastic one—was more involved than expected.

The vaccination part was probably my favorite. Trying out different vaccination rates and seeing how they affected the number of infections helped me visualize the idea of herd immunity in a really clear way. It made the theory feel much more real.

The spatial model was the toughest. Dealing with neighbors, checking boundaries, and making sure recovery happened correctly all took a while to get right. I used parts of the provided snippet but still had to figure out how to structure the rest of the simulation. It wasn’t perfect, but I learned a lot from the process.

Overall, this practical helped me understand how mathematical models connect to real-world problems. I also improved my confidence in writing simulations and using plots to interpret results. It was challenging, but rewarding.
